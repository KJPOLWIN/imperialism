# Compiling
## Linux
To compile this project you need to install SFML (instructions here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php#introduction) and g++ compiler.
After that run `make` command from project's directory. 
## Windows
Project in its current form can't be compiled on Windows, however since SFML is cross-platform library available also on Windows, project can be compiled after making changes in the Makefile. Makefile for Windows will be added in near future.
